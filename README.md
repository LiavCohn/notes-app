# notes-app
This project is a web-based note-taking application where users can create, view, and manage personal notes. The backend is built with Django, providing a robust API for handling note data and user authentication. JWT (JSON Web Token) is implemented for secure user authentication and session management. The frontend is developed using React, offering a dynamic and user-friendly interface for interacting with the notes. Users can sign up, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their notes, all while ensuring their data is protected with secure authentication mechanisms.
